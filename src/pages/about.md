heyoo! I'm Mike and I build a lot of infrastructure during the day, and game and fiddle with code at night.

I'm a Senior Systems Engineer at Twitch/Amazon. I work a lot with engineers in breaking down complicated technical solutions and I like to automate things I don't want to do.

End goal is to have a blog about stuff I work on, thoughts about working in the corporate world, and idk whatever i'm feeling. Thoughts are my own.
