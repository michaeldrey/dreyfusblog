heyoo! I'm mike and I build a lot of infrastructure during the day, and game and fiddle with code at night. 

I'm a DevOps engineering (officially I'm a Senior Systems Development Engineer but that's a mouthful). I'm a jack of all trades but I specialize in building infrastructure automation for AWS. In my free time I play a variety of video games, touch grass by hiking, and getting lost in the endless scroll of reels.

For now this site is a work in progress. End goal is to have a blog about stuff I work on, thoughts about working in the corporate world, and idk whatever i'm feeling.
