heyoo! I'm mike and I build a lot of infrastructure during the day, and game and fiddle with code at night. 

I'm a Senior Systems Engineer. I work a lot with engineers in breaking down complicted techincial solutions and i like to auto things i dont want to do.

End goal is to have a blog about stuff I work on, thoughts about working in the corporate world, and idk whatever i'm feeling.
